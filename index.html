                <p>One of the things we love about <a href="https://bit.ly/whyweb3">Web3 gaming</a> is the ability to buy, sell, and trade assets—your <a href="https://bit.ly/whatareilluvials-illuvidata">Illuvials</a> can be more than just a collection of digital creatures. They hold real value in the marketplace! But how do you know which Illuvials are worth capturing or upgrading?</p>
                <p>Well, here’s a solution: Viper’s video!</p>
                <p>We’ve featured Viper’s videos before here at Illuvidata (check them out <a href="https://bit.ly/advancedsecretsoverworld">here</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/viper036-illuvidata">here</a>) because he’s a fountain of knowledge when it comes to Illuvium. Even though this video was made last month, it’s still highly relevant—especially when it comes to understanding how stats influence both gameplay and the marketplace.</p>
                <p>In his video, he delivers a step-by-step breakdown of which stats you should care about, how they impact your Illuvials in battle, and what makes them valuable on the market. Check it out here:</p>

                <h2>Stat Breakdown: What Matters Most</h2>

                <p>Every Illuvial in Illuvium has a set of stats that determine how they perform in battle. These same stats also impact their market value. If you’re serious about getting the most out of your Illuvials, you need to understand which to prioritize.</p>
                <p>Here are the big ones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Health</b>: This stat determines how much damage an Illuvial can take before going down. It’s critical for Tanks which are built to soak up as much damage as possible. The higher the health, the longer they stay in the fight.</li>
                    <li><b>Attack Damage</b>: This is the raw power behind your Illuvial’s hits. Illuvials with high attack damage, like Fighters and Rogues, deal massive bursts of damage, but the catch is that attack damage alone isn't always enough—timing is key.</li>
                    <li><b>Attack Speed</b>: Illuvials that hit faster generate more energy (which fuels their abilities) and can overwhelm opponents by the sheer volume of attacks. </li>
                    <li><b>Resistance</b>: This stat reduces the damage your Illuvial takes from enemy attacks. It is critical to surviving longer in battle. Combined with health, it makes your Illuvial a defensive powerhouse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One more you should look at is an Illuvial’s Omega Power, which we look at in the next section. </p>
                <h2>Understanding Omega Power & Modifiers</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 30px; "><img style="height: 400px; width: 90%;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcMyuj6JJl5sm_xxiQaJXkLrBSik6TwsAynffXTnbsnQHWPylf2YevcT1baCLkONMlgKKAnBrfQPbLn1aSFgU8-G1lqpscwh50_zjOzTSugStjsLK-YLTYQF70iVU94w5OvDBZw2Cl7ZwoPlsh9b2clWo83?key=bL7NNj_Dah7CAMBbHtPwSw"></div>
                <p>Omega Power is a special stat that boosts certain abilities by multiplying their effectiveness. It acts as a percentage-based modifier—so, for example, an Illuvial with 200% Omega Power will deal double the base damage with its abilities. This stat is crucial for Illuvials that rely on abilities like shields or energy attacks.</p>
                <p>However, not all Illuvials benefit from Omega Power. Viper explains that you should only prioritize Omega Power if your Illuvial has abilities that directly scale with it, such as Axodon. Illuvials like Rhamphyre don’t rely on it at all, so focusing on this stat would be a waste for them. Always check your Illuvial’s ability descriptions to see if Omega Power is a worthwhile investment.</p>
                <h2>What to Prioritize: Attack Speed or Attack Damage</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 30px;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 80%;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeAVk3a00A_NTCHaNNDBvYlid2vGbVSihGj6hNvY2-WotO0YIYGbTi5jbddXElizVMkssc2Swxo0Kvt-zOWJoYr9kSb2loIY86YZmm0g0F84-4aKnE1NOs2sxnxz6-OvJp39-o1eAapvxTRWWBCx4BP9bF2?key=bL7NNj_Dah7CAMBbHtPwSw"></div>
                <section>
                    <a class="button-link"
                        href="https://illuvidata.gg/articles/66ec22f6f473611cdd6d32be">Read Post</a>
                </section>
                <p>One of the biggest debates in Illuvium strategy is the balance between attack speed and attack damage. Here’s Viper’s take:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Viper notes that in many cases, Attack Speed is more valuable than attack damage because it also impacts how often abilities are cast. Faster attacks mean more energy generation, which leads to quicker ability casts. This is especially true for <a href="https://bit.ly/illuviumarenabeginner-illuvidata">PvP matches</a>, where timing abilities can give you a serious edge.</li>
                    <li>Attack Damage is still important, but its value diminishes slightly as Illuvials level up. Viper points out that as you reach higher levels, the bonus from attack damage modifiers doesn’t scale as dramatically as attack speed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short: if your Illuvial is focused on dealing damage, attack speed is the stat you want to prioritize. But if you’re dealing with Illuvials that rely on big, powerful strikes, attack damage can still be critical.</p>
                <h2>Advanced Tips: Affinities & Classes</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 30px;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 80%;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5ONcg_P49Q1eYqEJByXZY1CpGzQ4Wk2DRi_FtkNZGtEuz6H7VQrXZKBs9iaWuWmjkhjTEvaf5dQpeUdruLThq3tQEs2fUc6V5RgA2bXoPTR3wNMhrOCGIDrUnS_R3DrautnzUYz1TGCNbFNEwUgxfr5HA?key=bL7NNj_Dah7CAMBbHtPwSw"></div>
                <p>Here’s where things get even more strategic. Viper breaks down how <a href="https://bit.ly/illuviumaffinities-illuvidata">Affinities</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/illuviumclasses-illuvidata">Classes</a> can impact your overall game plan.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Affinity: Some Illuvials gain extra effects based on their affinities. For example, every few auto-attacks, Templar class Illuvials deal increased Damage and decrease their Target's Resistances, distributing it to Allies in a Large Area. In cases like these, boosting attack speed can make a huge difference because it increases how often these abilities trigger.</li>
                    <li>Classes: Knowing which class your Illuvial belongs to can also help you optimize your team composition. Certain classes benefit from stacking specific stats, like health for Bulwarks or attack speed for Rogues. The more you understand these synergies, the better your Illuvials will perform in battle.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Optimizing Your Illuvials for the Marketplace</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 30px;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 80%;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcwEQTEAE-w72MW3w-z3PpmvCdvoRU92nIANs-bipPM2UH9edkA3Q7meU1Rre_EXX1rByTIx6cjgVSCD63LECE0JYF9mxX8MMyd6Tvlv6PeXUUMpppnlwJXLFZfnkjw82RliNylQcfSC91ZqtW46YTsZ820?key=bL7NNj_Dah7CAMBbHtPwSw"></div>
                <p>It took a while to get here, but now it’s time to talk marketplace strategy! When it comes to buying and selling Illuvials, Viper’s advice is invaluable. To maximize your Illuvial’s value, the first thing you need to do is focus on their stats—which is why we looked at them first.</p>
                <p>Here’s the gist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Illuvials with high attack speed or Omega Power are often more valuable because they perform better in PvP and PvE battles.</li>
                    <li>Health and resistance are important for Bulwarks, and these stats can make your Illuvial more appealing to players looking for defensive units.</li>
                    <li>Don’t forget about Class and Affinity—Illuvials with certain affinities or classes can be more valuable based on their <a href="https://bit.ly/classessynergiesaffinities-illiuvidata">synergies</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, if on the other hand, you’re looking to buy, Viper suggests taking advantage of the offer feature in the marketplace. Instead of purchasing Illuvials at full price, make a lower offer (around 50-60% of the listed price). This can save you a ton of money, especially if a seller is in a rush to offload their Illuvial.</p>
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 30px;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 80%;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeNCgFfrw-DwpvCCZzyS5EfbC9YqtVGi2ElatyMJBrMk_pY_Gs8kZxLFlf898kNtU6BDuDgUPGwnmctehftMINp0jS4WJUXsHcOjlyvc8VvgYLt38kRGimpKrZBU88Jtu5CZkmDB5csY6C_OrQL4wD9AQCt?key=bL7NNj_Dah7CAMBbHtPwSw"></div>
                <p>Understanding Illuvial stats is crucial for both gameplay and marketplace success. Whether you're trying to dominate the arena or maximize your profits, knowing which stats matter and how they interact with your Illuvials’ abilities is the key to success.</p>
